Show/Hide  SubSpace Navigation for Confluence from Comunardo

This is not a plugin as such, but a macro that can be added to the Global Custom Html page.

The hide/show is personal and persists between sessions.

The solution has been tested with Chrome + Confluence 6.15.9 and SubSpace Navigation for Confluence 3.3.3

Quite crude/brutal solution, but provides a requested feature (for now)
